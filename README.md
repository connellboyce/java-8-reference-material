- <b><u>overload</u></b> - Providing a new implementation for an existing method but also configuring it to accept different parameters
- <b><u>override</u></b> - Providing a new implementation for an existing method
- <b><u>polymorphism</u></b> - Extending a class into a child class; Having a broad class (like car) be extended upon by a specific class (like Ford)
